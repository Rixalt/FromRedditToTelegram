# FromRedditToTelegram
A bot for parsing img gif's &amp; videos from Reddit to Telegram

This is a tool that will primarily help you manage Telegram channels, taking posts from Reddit as a basis. In this example, subreddits with cats are written.
To function, you need to use a database with the used_images table to record links to images to avoid re-posting images in telegrams
